# Yay! You're a Rubyist on Rails!

Welcome onboard Rubyists on Rails! You have secured your seat.
This is Daisuke (@osyoyu) and Sorah (@sorah) from Cookpad.

This mail contains important information for boarding the train, so please take a careful look.

## Delivery of Tickets

If you have a permanent address in Japan, we'll send your ticket by post. Please tell us your post address where to send your tickets!  
We've attached a Google Forms link on the email sent from connpass. Form will be closed on 20 April 2023, so please don't be late!

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!**  
We can't deliver tickets outside of Japan. For those who don't have a permanent address in Japan, we are making arrangements so that we can hand you tickets in person, prior to the trip.

Please tell us when you are coming to Tokyo (if you are) through the above form so that we can make arrangements for you! If you're joining the [Asakusa.rb Welcome Drinkup](https://asakusarb.doorkeeper.jp/events/154786), we can hand your ticket there.

Don't worry even if we can't meet before the trip - We'll find you at Shinjuku Station.

## Train assignments for those who have selected "Either"

Assignments can be found in the email we've sent via connpass.

## Boarding at Shinjuku

We will not be conducting roll call on the day of the trip. Please check the time and seat number indicated on your ticket and board Azusa (特急あずさ) at Shinjuku station (新宿駅) accordingly. Make sure not to be late!

### Find the right gate

As you may be aware, the Shinjuku station where Azusa departs, is one of the [most complex, busiest, crowded train stations in Japan](https://www.google.com/search?q=busiest+railway+station+in+the+world). You'll need to find the right gate to board Azusa.

Azusa is a JR train. Make sure you're entering a JR gate, especially if you're coming to Shinjuku by using trains from other companies.

Because a group discount is applied on your tickets, those cannot be used with automated gates. Find a staff-attended gate (you'll find one near automated gates) and present your ticket to enter.

- **If you are coming to Shinjuku from other JR stations in Tokyo**: Find a staffed gate and present your Rubyists on Rails ticket at your closest JR station.
- **If you are coming to Shinjuku using non-JR trains (Keio, Odakyu, Tokyo Metro)**: Find a staffed JR transfer gate at Shinjuku and present your Rubyists on Rails ticket there. Or, simply exit gate once and find JR gates.
- **If you are entering directly at Shinjuku (e.g. you're coming to Shinjuku by bus or taxi)**: Find a staffed JR gate and present your ticket.

In case you find it difficult to participate for any reason, please contact us at sponsorships@cookpad.com as soon as possible.

### Find your train

We believe the trains depart from JR Platform 9 or 10, but please find Azusa express (特急あずさ) for Matsumoto at information displays onsite. Displays should look like the following:

- "特急あずさ 5号 8:00 南小谷" (means: Azusa express #5 for Minami-Otari, departs 8:00 am)
- "特急あずさ 33号 15:00 松本" (means: Azusa express #33 for Matsumoto, departs 3:00 pm)

We are looking forward to seeing you on Rubyists on Rails!
